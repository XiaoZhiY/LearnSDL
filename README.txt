In order to compile these files, your should change INCLUDE PATH to your own SDL2/include.
And change LIBRARY_PATHS to where your libs locate.

#INCLUDE_PATHS specifies the additional include paths we'll need
INCLUDE_PATHS = -ID:\dev\include\SDL2

#LIBRARY_PATHS specifies the additional library paths we'll need
LIBRARY_PATHS = -LD:\dev\lib
